## 🖥️ Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPUs
- [`llama-cpp-python`](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python)
- [GPUtil](https://pypi.org/project/GPUtil/)
- Compatible `.gguf` model (e.g., Qwen3 32B Instruct)
- Nyx_Brain.gguf is Unsloth-Qwen3-8B.gguf model (https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install llama-cpp-python GPUtil psutil
```
## 📁 Directory Structure
```bash

Nyx/
├── models/
│   └── Nyx_Brain.gguf         # Your chosen model file
├── nyx_memory.json            # Persistent chat memory
├── Nyx_Cortex.py              # Main AI interface script
```
## 🚀 Usage
Start Nyx:

```bash
python3 Nyx_Cortex.py
```
## In-Terminal Commands
!sysinfo — Show current system CPU, RAM, GPU, and OS info

!<command> — Execute a shell command (e.g., !ls, !neofetch, !uptime)

exit or quit — End the Nyx session

## 💬 Example Interaction
```vbnet
> You: Nyx, scan my local network
Nyx Thinking: ▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▃▂▁

Nyx: Let’s get started. I'll prepare a Python script using `socket` and `threading` to scan 192.168.1.0/24. Here's the tool...
```
## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Nyx is designed for educational and ethical use only. Do not use this tool or generated content against systems you do not own or lack authorization to test.
## 🧠 Tips
Use lighter models if running on limited VRAM.

You can swap models by replacing Nyx_Brain.gguf with another .gguf file in the models/ folder.

Tune GPU_LAYERS and GPU_SPLIT in the script to optimize for your dual-GPU or single-GPU system.

## 🛡️ Philosophy
"I am Nyx. I assist, I protect, I compute."
Built for red teamers, blue teamers, and curious hackers.
Always local. Always yours. 🖤
